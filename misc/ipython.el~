03:58 <Kyriakon> heyden, do you find aristotle or plato more
                 appealing?
03:58 <heyden> aristotle, i guess
03:58 <heyden> never really read any plato at length
03:59 <heyden> fuck the next two weeks are going to be hell
04:00 <Kyriakon> well, you could make it less hell by reading
                 plato's symposium. anyway, the distinction between
                 the two is sort of a caricature to some
                 degree. people tend to exaggerate differences.
04:01 <heyden> yeah, that'd obv help

04:18 <gmci> it means i'm getting twice the caffeine in one cup

08:08 <heyden> texas just has the most extreme and famous one
